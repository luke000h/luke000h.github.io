# Operations Centre Ammunition Technical Support

Provided a single point of contact for ammunition technical advice across defence and ensured correct regulatory procedures for munition incident reporting across land services.

Processed and allocated personnel in the delivery of Ammunition Technical Support (ATS) requests for UK and overseas deployments.

Effectively combined MS Teams, Planner and Power Automate to roll out a system that increased the efficiency of ATS taskings whilst capturing reporting statistics.

Used Power Automate and SharePoint Lists to create a database for tracking and storing munition incident reports and sending automatic deadline reminders.

Constructed a MS PowerApp and worked with contractors in Army HQ to integrate it into the Armyâ€™s CHURCHILL platform. It improved transparency for ATS requests whilst allowing requesters to specify their exact needs without technical knowledge.
