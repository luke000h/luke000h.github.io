- Contributed to a team project by simplifying the process of creating standard build pipeline scripts, improving efficiency by reducing boilerplate code. To achieve this he built a Jenkins shared library that reduced the pipeline to a single function call.
- Setup and introduced Docker containers to a project to solve dependancy issues.
- Built a website crawler to test site access and dynamically provide site locators for UI testing saving time manually finding them and improving reliability.
