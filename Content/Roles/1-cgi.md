# Software Developer

Software developer with a focus on infrastructure and testing.

- Simplified the process of creating build pipeline scripts, improving efficiency by reducing boilerplate code. This was achieved with a Jenkins shared library that reduced the pipeline code to a single function call.

- Setup and introduced Docker containers to solve dependancy issues in projects.

- Built a website crawler to test site access and dynamically provide site locators for UI testing saving manual efforts and improving reliability.
