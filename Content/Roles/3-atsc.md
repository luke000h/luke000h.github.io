### Operations Centre Ammunition Technical Support

This role was varied, with many responsibilities in the HQ of bomb disposal for the UK, which included providing explosive safety governance to the UK military.

- Processed requests and allocated expert explosive safety advisers in support of UK and overseas deployments.

- The information required for planning and tracking the deployment of personnel was being double entered into two systems leading to errors. Seeing the opportunity for improvement, a system combining MS Teams, Planner and Power Automate was built and rolled out increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

- Working within the bounds of the restricted military IT system, Power Automate and SharePoint Lists were utilised to create a database for tracking and storing munition incident reports and sending automatic deadline reminders.

- The process for requesting explosive experts for deployments involved a dated PDF form and a long email approval chain, resulting in last minute deployments. Using MS Power Apps, a web app was produced that replaced the whole process providing a improved experience for the requester, shorter request timelines and greater transparency for personnel planning. This was recognised and work was conducted with contractors in Army HQ to integrate it into another Army platform.
