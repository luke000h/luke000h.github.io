# Special Response Bomb Disposal Team Member

Member of a team providing specialist technical bomb disposal response.

- Collaborated with the Home Office, Atomic Weapons Establishment and international counterparts in the delivery and execution of training exercises.

- Responsible for the design and production of bomb disposal training devices used to validate UK advanced bomb disposal operators, FBI and other overseas counterparts. This involved understanding the threat picture and conceptualising devices that would test operators at the right level. The devices ranged from fully mechanical, to a combination of discreet electronics and software based components.

- Designed and produced a monitoring system for training devices. Display GUI and logic written in C. It replaced previous systems as the GUI and user defined input allowed for increased flexibility, usability and troubleshooting.
