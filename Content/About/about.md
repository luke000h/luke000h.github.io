I am a software developer driven by a passion for creating solutions and solving complex problems. My recent focus has been on Swift for iOS development and Python, though I have a broad background that includes embedded C, web technologies, and Microsoft Power Platform. I have experience in producing intuitive user interfaces, data analysis and improving workflow efficiancy with automated testing and CI/CD.

My journey into software development began with self-taught full-stack web development for my UXO consultancy business. My diverse career in technical roles, including the British Army and Royal Navy, demonstrates my adaptability, resilience, and ability to thrive in various environments. I'm eager to bring my expertise and determination to new challenges.
