I am a software developer driven by a passion for creating solutions and solving complex problems. My recent focus has been on Swift for iOS development and Arduino (C), though I have a broad background that includes Python, web technologies, and Microsoft Power Platform. I have experience in automating workflows, optimizing build processes with CI/CD, and enhancing testing infrastructure to improve efficiency and reliability. I have built automated tools like web crawlers for testing, and developed data storage utilities to streamline operations. 

My journey into software development began with self-taught full-stack web development for my UXO consultancy business. My diverse career in technical roles, including the British Army and Royal Navy, demonstrates my adaptability, resilience, and ability to thrive in various environments. I'm eager to bring my expertise and determination to new challenges to effectively meet project requirements.
