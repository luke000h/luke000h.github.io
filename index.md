## Career history

### May 2024 - present | CGI | Software Developer    

Software developer with a focus on infrastructure and testing.
- A shared repo contained many Jenkins build pipelines that copied boilerplate code not adhering to the DRY principle. To simplify these common build pipelines I created a shared library that reduced the pipeline to a single function call.
- I have created test containers to solve dependancy issues.
- I created a website crawler to dynamically find link locators for flakey UI tests.

### Feb 2023 - May 2024 | Speacial Response Bomb Disposal Team
